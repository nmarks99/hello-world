# Machine Learning Practice Projects
This folder contains various beginner machine learning projects to learn the basics of machine learning.

Update: Most of this is no longer very useful I don't think...linear regression examples are not as easy
to follow here as they are in the EE475 repo and especially my autodiff repo.
