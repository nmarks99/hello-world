# Futbol
This is a python script which I am making which will scrape a website to get soccer info/scores.

## TODO:
 - Make the script runnable from a single call from the command line such as simply typing "futbol"
 - Only give information on teams and leagues I am interested in.
    - Make this something I can modify later
 - Report back the current matches today.
    - If the match is over, report the final score
    - If the match is currently underway, report the current score and time (and maybe other stuff)
    - If the match has yet to begin, report the time it will start.
- Report on upcoming matches in the next week.
